This is an old message dispatcher/listener component that was extracted from the "Zym Project" a long time ago (this project no longer seems to exist). It's something we use in some of our application code, but wanted to extract to a separate package for re-use (and possibly easier replacement/deprecation in the future).

This has been feature complete for a long time, we're only planning to maintain it as necessary to keep it working on new PHP versions.
